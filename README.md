Hello and welcome to my portfolio. Here, I have added a few of my recent projects. 
  1.  Donor Database
      	Intro: 
        	A Project using Talend Open Studio for an enterprise using an Oracle and an Azure SQL database. 
      	Purpose:
      		For an employee at a nonprofit organization to be able to insert donation lists into the database by importing a filled-out CSV file into Talend Open Studio rather than inputting records manually. 		This project also verifies the integrity of the records being inserted and rejects the values that are not acceptable. For example, a record has an address that is not in the city where donations
      		are being collected from.
		In this case, the program will create a new rejected values CSV file or use an existing one if there is one, and copy and paste the rejected row to the rejected rows CSV file.
